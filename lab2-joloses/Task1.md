# Task 1 - Practice Terminal Commands

For this task, you will be reproducing a particular directory structure with a series of files and folders, similar to what we did in class.

## Installing Tree

In case you missed the installation instructions to install tree, they are linked here:

- On Windows, if you cannot find the tree command, please follow the instructions in the [setup guide](https://firas.moosvi.com/courses/2021_WT1/data301/notes/setup/install_ds_stack_windows.html#tree).

- On Linux or macOS, you may need to install tree (if you didn't already do it in the dungeon) with: `conda install -c conda-forge tree`.

## A. Create Directory Structure

The files should be named the same way, but you can leave them empty if you want.

*Hint: Start by creating a directory called `Task1` in your lab directory, using the command:*

```
mkdir Task1
```

If you followed the suggested directory structure, this directory should be here: `~/school/year3/data301/lab2-github-username/Task1`

You may need the following commands:

- [`cd`](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/cd.1p.html) : change directory
- [`pwd`](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/pwd.1.html) : print working directory
- [`mkdir`](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/mkdir.1.html): make directory (note the `-p` option)
- [`ls`](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/ls.1.html): list directory contents
- [`touch`](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/touch.1.html): create an empty file with a specific name
- `code`/`pico`/`nano`/`vim`: edit the file in a text editor

## B. Run `tree`

In this task (after you create the directory structure in Task 1A), we will use the `tree` command to output the directory structure **inside your lab1 directory**.

First, open a Terminal and run the following command **inside your lab1 directory**:

```
cd Task1
tree
```

You should get an output that looks something like this in your Terminal:

```
.
├── level1A
│   ├── file1.md
│   └── level2A
│       ├── file2.md
│       └── level3A
│           └── file3.md
├── level1B
│   ├── level2B
│   │   └── newfile2.md
│   └── newfile1.md
└── root.md

5 directories, 6 files
```
## C. Save the output of `tree` to a file

To redirect the output of any command into a file, you can use the `>` command.
Let's do that for the `tree` command:

```
tree > directory_tree.txt
```

There should now be a new file in your `Task1` directory called `directory_tree.txt`.

## D. Add, commit, and push your changes to GitHub

You are encouraged to commit, add and push intermediate changes in your repository, just remember to add a useful commit message.

```
git add .
git commit -m "Finished creating the directory structure."
git push
```

**Note: Empty directories will not show up on GitHub.com so each directory must have a file in it (even if it is empty).**

You are now ready to move on to [Task 2](./Task2)!
