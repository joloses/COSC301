# Task 3 - Learning Markdown (Part 2)

In this task, we will continue learning and exploring Markdown.

First, let's get ready by creating a new file to practice in:

## Task 3.1: Creating a new file

1. Create a new file called `activity_task3.md` file and open it in VS Code.
You can do this in one line using this command:

```
code activity_task3.md
```
If this does not open a blank file in VS Code, I suggest revisiting the install instructions to make sure that you can open VS Code from the Terminal.

## Task 3.2: Practice Advanced Markdown Syntax

While you practice with Markdown syntax, it is useful to see a "Preview" of what it will look like.
Here's the effect of the preview extension you installed in VS Code:

1. Practice adding the following [Markdown elements](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/) into `activity_task3.md`:

1. Write a line of code "in-line" with a sentence like this: `print('hello world')` (Note, this code is not going to run (we will talk about this next week), it is only going to be formatted slightly differently so it stands out as code compared to the rest of the text.)
1. Write a block of code after a sentence like this: 
```
num =  10
if num < 5:
    print('Number is less than 5.')
else:
    print('Number is greater than 5.')
```
1. Add a horizontal line using `---`.
1. Add a clickable link in the `activity.md` file like this: [link text](https://cbc.ca).
1. Add a local (i.e. on your computer/repository) image to this file like this:
```
![description of image](dir.png)
```
1. Add an image linked from the internet, for instance [this xkcd comic](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/angular_momentum.jpg):
```
![Comic about Angular momentum](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/angular_momentum.jpg)

```
1. Add a table of your favourite fruits (make sure to have at least 4 rows), their colour, shape, and size using Markdown syntax like this:
```
| Fruit | Colour | Shape | Size |
| ----- | ------ | ----- | ---- |
|       |        |       |      |
|       |        |       |      |
|       |        |       |      |
```

### Add, commit, and push your changes to GitHub

Open a Terminal and navigate to where you have cloned your lab (hint: you can use the `cd` command to change directories, and `pwd` command to print out where you are currently in your directory tree).
Add, commit, and then push your changes to GitHub.com using the following commands (we will talk about what exactly this means in class):

```
git add .
git commit -m "Finished Task 3 markdown syntax."
git push
```

## Task 3.3: Submit your Lab on Gradescope

See [the README file](./README.md) on instructions, and a video on how to submit your lab on Gradescope.

**NOTE: If you make any changes to your GitHub repository, you MUST re-submit on Gradescope to make sure we grade the latest version of your repository. You may submit on Gradescope as many times as you like.**

That's it! 
Nice and easy, lots of new things learned...
You're all done Lab 1!
